# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction Web App

## Overview

This project is a machine learning-based web application developed using Streamlit and Python to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. By inputting 13 key health parameters, users can receive a real-time prediction indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.
