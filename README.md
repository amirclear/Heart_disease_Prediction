‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction Web App
Overview
This project is a machine learning-based web application developed using Streamlit and Python to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. By inputting 13 key health parameters, users can receive a real-time prediction indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

üî¨ Model Details
Algorithm: Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
Dataset: Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset
Features:
Age
Sex
Chest Pain Type (cp)
Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
Serum Cholesterol (chol)
Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
ST Depression Induced by Exercise (oldpeak)
Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)
Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)
Thalassemia (thal)

üöÄ Features
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
Real-Time Prediction: Instant results upon input submission.
Visual Feedback: Clear indicators for prediction outcomes.
Model Deployment: Can be hosted on platforms like Streamlit Cloud or Heroku.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: Programming language
Streamlit: Framework for building the web application
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model development
joblib: For saving and loading the trained model
NumPy: For numerical operations
